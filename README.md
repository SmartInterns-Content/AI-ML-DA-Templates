# EDA on Rainfall Prediction

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on weather conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind, and other meteorological features. The goal is to assist in early decision-making for farmers, meteorologists, and planners.

---

## 🧪 Approach

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Loaded weather dataset and handled missing values.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Analyzed distributions, feature relationships, and target variable insights using visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categorical features, scaled numerical features.
4. **Modeling**: Used machine learning algorithms for binary classification (RainTomorrow: Yes/No).
5. **Deployment**: Built a Flask web app to take user inputs and predict rainfall.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **File**: `Weather.csv - Dataset.csv`
- **Size**: \~12,000 records
- **Features**:
  - `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall`, `WindSpeed9am`, `WindSpeed3pm`, `Humidity9am`, `Humidity3pm`, etc.
  - Target: `RainTomorrow` (Yes/No)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots for humidity, temperature, wind
- Missing value treatment

All done in the Jupyter notebook: `new.ipynb`

## 🤖 Model Building

- Label Encoding: `encoder.pkl`
- Imputation: `impter.pkl`
- Feature Scaling: `scale.pkl`
- Trained ML Model: `rainfall.pkl`

Model predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on current input data.

## 🌐 Web Application (Flask)

- **Main script**: `app.py`
- **Templates**: `index.html`, `chance.html`, `nochance.html`
- User selects weather inputs, and the app returns a prediction.
